    <text>    Hello!

     Here is a Go language interactive tutorial, interactive - because you can edit the code and then execute it immedeately to see the results of your changes.

     The tutorial is very simple to navigate, it has minimum of tools. Just click on a tree node to see appropriate content in a text editor. If this is a code fragment, clicking on a '>' button, which is in a right top corner of a window above the editor will execute this code. The "Fmt" button uses gofmt program to format the code in the editor window. '+', '-' buttons are intended to increase/decrease a font size in the editor window.

     Thanks for your attention.
     Alexander S.Kresin.
